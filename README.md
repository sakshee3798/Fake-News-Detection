Fake news is spreading like wildfire these days, and people are sharing it without confirming it. This is frequently intended to maximize or impose specific views, and it is frequently accomplished through political agendas. To obtain online advertising revenue, media outlets must be able to draw viewers to their websites. As a result, it is vital to recognize fake news. A predictive model is built to predict whether the news is fake or real.
The initial procedure involved data collection, then data cleaning, and further model building. The models that were used to predict the credibility of News were Logistics Regression, Decision Tree Classification, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. Finally, the conclusion that came up was that the Gradient Boosting classifier predicted whether the news was fake or real with an accuracy of 99.57%.
